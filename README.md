# BlockBox

**Revolutionary Decentralized File Storage with Military-Grade Encryption**

BlockBox is a cutting-edge Web3 application that provides secure, decentralized file storage using blockchain technology, IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), and client-side encryption. Built with React and modern Web3 technologies, BlockBox ensures your data remains private, secure, and accessible only to you.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly across all devices

## üõ† Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager
- **MetaMask** browser extension or compatible Web3 wallet
- **Modern browser** with Web3 support

### Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shaurya2k06/BlockBox.git
cd BlockBox/frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. **Start the development server**:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

## üìñ Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Connect Your Wallet**
   - Click "Connect Wallet" on the landing page
   - Approve the connection in MetaMask
   - Your wallet address becomes your identity

2. **Upload Files**
   - Navigate to the dashboard
   - Drag & drop files or click to browse
   - Files are automatically encrypted using your wallet-derived key
   - Encrypted files are uploaded to IPFS

3. **Manage Files**
   - View all your encrypted files in the dashboard
   - Download and decrypt files instantly
   - Copy IPFS CIDs for sharing or backup
   - Delete files you no longer need

### Security Model

```javascript
// Your encryption key is derived from your wallet
const encryptionKey = generateKey(walletAddress);

// Files are encrypted client-side
const encryptedData = encryptFile(file, encryptionKey);

// Only encrypted data is uploaded to IPFS
const cid = await uploadToIPFS(encryptedData);
```

### File Operations

- **Upload**: Files are encrypted locally then stored on IPFS
- **Download**: Files are retrieved from IPFS and decrypted locally
- **Share**: Share IPFS CIDs while maintaining encryption
- **Delete**: Remove files from your personal storage index

## üèó Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 19**: Modern React with latest features
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations and transitions
- **Ethers.js**: Ethereum blockchain interaction
- **CryptoJS**: Client-side encryption library

### Core Services
- **Web3 Service**: Wallet connection and blockchain interaction
- **IPFS Service**: Decentralized file storage operations
- **Encryption Service**: Client-side file encryption/decryption
- **Storage Service**: Local storage management

## üîí Security Considerations

- **Private Keys**: Keep your wallet private keys secure
- **Backup Strategy**: Consider backing up IPFS CIDs
- **Network Security**: Use secure networks for sensitive operations
- **Browser Security**: Keep your browser and extensions updated

## üöÄ Deployment

### Frontend Deployment

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to your preferred hosting service
# (Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3, etc.)
```

### IPFS Node Setup (Optional)

For enhanced decentralization, consider running your own IPFS node:

```bash
# Install IPFS
npm install -g ipfs

# Initialize IPFS node
ipfs init

# Start IPFS daemon
ipfs daemon
```

## üìã Browser Support

- **Chrome/Chromium** (Recommended)
- **Firefox**
- **Safari** (with limitations)
- **Edge**

*Note: Web3 functionality requires MetaMask or compatible wallet extension*

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Wallet Connection Failed**
   - Ensure MetaMask is installed and unlocked
   - Check network settings
   - Refresh the page and try again

2. **Upload Errors**
   - Check file size limits
   - Verify IPFS service availability
   - Ensure stable internet connection

3. **File Not Found**
   - IPFS content may take time to propagate
   - Try accessing from different IPFS gateways
   - Check if file was properly uploaded
